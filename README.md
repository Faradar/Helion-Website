## General info
This is the main project designed for the web development course at Coderhouse. It's a responsive website desgined to learn and practice my HTML and CSS skills. I've added some additional JavaScript to make the navbar functional and responsive. I could have used Bootstrap but I should probably master basic CSS before I start using a framework.

I chose a medieval fantasy setting as the baseline of my website for a couple of reasons:
1. I didn't want to make another ecommerce page since that's probably what everyone else was doing.
2. It's what I'm passionate about. I play a lot of TTRPGs with my friends so it's something I could use to enhance that hobby.

## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- The design is rather simplistic and I would like to make it a bit more aesthetically pleasing.
- The races and character pages are rather similar to each other and lack a distinguishing feature.

To do:
- Make the code more efficient.
